# Decimate Polygon
Simplify a 2D closed, piecewise linear contour by specifying boundary offset tolerance.

Includes Python and MATLAB implementations, the former translated from the latter.
Translation was done by the original author of this repository.
The original MATLAB source code, written by Anton Semechko (2011), [was retreived from MathWorks File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34639-decimate-polygon "Decimate Polygon") and is included in this repo for the purpose of comparison and to better keep track of potential future improvements to either version.
